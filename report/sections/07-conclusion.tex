\label{sec:conclusion}
This study aimed at bettering our understanding of the quality of the code generated by ChatGPT as part of the MSR2024 Mining Challenge. To do so, we used \textit{Pyscent}, an automatic code smell detection tool for Python to analyse all the Python code snippets in the MSR2024 dataset. We then compared these results to the amount of code smells found in code snippets extracted from Python related questions on Stack Overflow.

We found that ChatGPT produces around 1\% more code smells than the answers found on Stack Overflow. We also found that ChatGPT tended to produce more Too Many Attributes, Shotgun Surgery and Long List Comprehension code smells compared to Stack Overflow, but it did not produce a single Long Method or Long Lambda whereas some were found in the answers extracted from Stack Overflow.

Following the results of this study, developers should keep in mind that wherever they find code snippets to fix their problems, they should always be aware of the potential presence of code smells, as they seem to be present both in ChatGPT's answers as well as in online forums such as Stack Overflow.

However, future work would be required to see if this trend is present across other programming languages or online sources such as documentation or tutorials. Furthermore, future work could be done to see if developers adapt the code snippets provided by ChatGPT to remove code smells before integrating them into their projects. \\
