You're more likely to find Node.js libraries for these protocols.That said, it's technically possible to implement PCP in Node.js yourself, although doing so would require a thorough understanding of both the protocol (as defined in RFC 6887) and Node.js network programming. PCP involves sending and receiving specially formatted UDP packets, which Node.js is capable of with its dgram module. However, implementing a protocol like this from scratch can be a significant undertaking.As an alternative, if you're looking for a way to perform automatic port forwarding in Node.js, you might want to look into libraries for UPnP or NAT-PMP. The nat-upnp library is one option for UPnP. Here's a basic example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Remember, automatic port forwarding can have security implications, so always use it with caution.

Since Android 10 (API level 29), due to Scoped Storage, apps do not have unrestricted access to the file system. Instead, apps have access to app-specific directories and media files. This is not related to permissions you're requesting in AndroidManifest.xml - that's a different issue.The error message you're seeing requires that you obtain access using ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT or related APIs means that Android wants you to use Storage Access Framework (SAF) APIs to access the file.The react-native-document-picker library you're using handles file selection correctly. The URI that's returned is a content URI, and Android expects you to use content resolvers to access the file data.The good news is that you don't need to ask for the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission if you're using this library. The ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT permission implicitly grants read access to the selected file, regardless of its actual location on the filesystem.Here's a basic example of how you could read file data from a content URI in a React Native Android module:[CODE_BLOCK_0]You need to call this method from your React Native JavaScript code with the URI you received from react-native-document-picker:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Note that you have to replace YourModule with the actual name of your native module. This is a very basic example, you would probably want to do something more meaningful with the data read from the InputStream.Finally, you mentioned that your app does not have any permissions listed in its settings. This might indicate that there's something wrong with how you're requesting permissions.

If I set in second library's package.json to depend on the first library, this means in the JS bindings of the second library, I can `require` the precompiled binary of the first library just before `require` of the second library's binary.\n\nThis means compiling the second library only uses the headers that would be exposed in the first library's npm package. It would effectively mean using npm as a way of distributing the shared objects too.\n\nWhen compiling the second library does that mean I'm won't be using the `-l` flag?", "Answer": "That's correct. If you're following the first approach, you won't be using the -l flag when you compile the second library. This is because you're not linking against the first library at compile time. Instead, you'll be accessing its symbols dynamically at runtime.In this scenario, the Node.js code for the second library should require the first library before it requires the second library. This ensures that the first library's symbols are loaded into memory and available for the second library to use. Here's a simple example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the C code for the second library, you should include the headers for the first library. This allows the compiler to check that you're using the first library's symbols correctly:[CODE_BLOCK_1]When you compile the second library, you'll need to make sure that the first library's header files are in the compiler's include path. You can use the -I flag to add directories to the include path:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Remember to replace /path/to/first/library/headers with the actual path to the first library's header files.This approach should work as long as the first library's shared object file is loaded into memory before the second library's shared object file. You're essentially using Node.js and npm to manage the distribution and loading of the shared libraries, and relying on the dynamic linker to resolve symbols at runtime.
