This ensures that an object can have either the isHr property or the optional properties, but not both.Finally, we created an array objects of type MyObject[] that can hold objects conforming to the defined structure. You can add objects with either the isHr property or the optional variables to this array.Using this approach, TypeScript will provide type checking and prevent you from adding objects that violate the defined structure.", "ListOfCode": [{"ReplaceString": "[CODE_BLOCK_0]", "Type": "typescript", "Content": "type ObjectWithHr = {\n  isHr: boolean;\n};\n\ntype ObjectWithVariables = {\n  var1?: number;\n  var2?: string;\n  var3?: boolean;\n};\n\ntype MyObject = ObjectWithHr | ObjectWithVariables;\n\nconst objects: MyObject[] = [\n  { isHr: true },\n  { var1: 10, var2: \"hello\", var3: true },\n  { var1: 20 },\n  { var2: \"world\" },\n];\n"}]}, {"Prompt": "I copied your code exactly as above and typescript is allowing me to pass the object with isHr and var1.

You are correct, TypeScript does allow the object { isHr: true, var1: 5 } to be passed in the example I provided. I made an oversight in my explanation.If you want to enforce stricter type checking to disallow objects with both isHr and the optional variables, you can use TypeScript's discriminated unions. Discriminated unions are a way to define a common property that can be used to determine the specific shape of an object within a union.Here's an updated example using discriminated unions:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated example, I added a type property to both ObjectWithHr and ObjectWithVariables. The type property acts as a discriminant, allowing TypeScript to differentiate between the two types.Now, if you try to add an object with both isHr and the optional variables, such as { type: 'hr', isHr: true, var1: 5 }, TypeScript will raise a type error because it violates the discriminated union's structure.I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous response, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention.", "ListOfCode": [{"ReplaceString": "[CODE_BLOCK_0]", "Type": "typescript", "Content": "type ObjectWithHr = {\n  type: 'hr';\n  isHr: boolean;\n};\n\ntype ObjectWithVariables = {\n  type: 'variables';\n  var1?: number;\n  var2?: string;\n  var3?: boolean;\n};\n\ntype MyObject = ObjectWithHr | ObjectWithVariables;\n\nconst objects: MyObject[] = [\n  { type: 'hr', isHr: true },\n  { type: 'variables', var1: 10, var2: \"hello\", var3: true },\n  { type: 'variables', var1: 20 },\n  { type: 'variables', var2: \"world\" },\n  { type: 'hr', isHr: true, var1: 5 } // This will now result in a type error\n];\n"}]}, {"Prompt": "I don't like the inclusion of a type property.

You can use the never type along with conditional types to achieve a similar effect without introducing a separate type property. Here's an updated example using the never type:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this updated example, I defined ObjectWithHr to have the isHr property and the optional properties (var1, var2, and var3) with a type of never. The never type represents a type that should never occur.Conversely, in ObjectWithVariables, I set isHr to have the never type, which means it should never be present, while the optional properties (var1, var2, and var3) are allowed.By using the never type in this way, you achieve a similar effect of disallowing objects with both isHr and the optional variables.

The ObjectWithHr type now only has the isHr property.By doing so, you separate the concerns of ObjectWithHr and ObjectWithVariables. Adding more variables to ObjectWithVariables won't impact ObjectWithHr, and vice versa.
