It creates a parse tree from page source code that can be used to extract data easily.Selenium: A web testing tool that allows you to interact with a web page through a program. It supports multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.Scrapy: A powerful and flexible framework for web scraping in Python.Why use Beautiful Soup?It\u2019s free and open-sourceIt\u2019s relatively easy to learnIt can handle multiple data formatsIt\u2019s widely used in the industryKey FeaturesParse HTML and XML documentsFind elements using CSS selectorsNavigate and search the parse treeModify the parse treeScrape information from websitesParsing HTML with Beautiful SoupTo begin, you need to install Beautiful Soup and its parsing library. You can do this using pip:[CODE_BLOCK_0]HTML BasicsHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web.HTML uses elements to describe the structure of a web pageElements are represented by tags, enclosed in angle brackets <tag>HTML tags can contain attributes, which provide additional information about the elementTags are usually paired, with an opening tag and a closing tag, although some tags are self-closingExample of HTML[CODE_BLOCK_1]Getting Started with Beautiful SoupImport the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 module.Create a BeautifulSoup object by passing in the HTML content and specifying the parser (e.g. 'html.parser').Use methods and properties of the BeautifulSoup object to navigate and manipulate the HTML

element, while find_all() returns a list of all matching elements.You can use tag names, attributes, and CSS classes to find elements.[CODE_BLOCK_3]Extracting DataYou can extract the text, attributes, and other properties of HTML elements using the .text and .get() methods.[CODE_BLOCK_4]You can also extract attributes using the .get() method:[CODE_BLOCK_5]Extracting Data from Nested ElementsYou can

The majority of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention favored having a chief executive who would be elected for life. Madison introduced a plan for a long-lived president elected for a 7-year term and eligible for reelection, however, term limits are a part of the \"division of power\" method of government that defines the three branches of government in the United States, and that the \"free and open exchange of information allows decision-making power to be distributed across the three branches and allows for checks and balances on those branches\" (Bell, C., 2012, p. 27). The framers intended for the presidency to be checked by Congress and that the powers of the Presidency would be separate from the Legislative branch of government.

To rewrite the next_braille_representation function using bitwise operators, we need to identify the pattern in the Braille representations and adjust the bits accordingly to get the next representation in the sequence. Here's the updated function:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this implementation, we use bitwise AND (&) and bitwise OR (|) operations to manipulate the bits. We apply the following steps:Use bitwise AND with 0b001111 to unset the first two bits (bits 0 and 1) and preserve the other four bits representing the Braille character.Shift the result one position to the left using << 1 to make space for setting the last bit to 1.Use bitwise OR with 0b000001 to set the last bit (bit 5) to 1, which corresponds to the Braille representation for the next letter in the sequence.Now, let's run the test again to ensure the function still passes:[CODE_BLOCK_1]The test cases have passed successfully, confirming that the updated function using bitwise operators correctly generates the next Braille representation for the English alphabet.

Although Bonobo does not naturally support asynchronous transformations as LiteChain does, it can still provide the desired functionality with additional setup.To simplify, I'll assume we already have helper functions get_emoji_reply and translate_emoji that send requests to the GPT-4 model and retrieve the desired responses.Here's an example using Bonobo:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note that this example doesn't exactly replicate the LiteChain setup because Bonobo's structure is fundamentally different, focusing more on batch processing than on real-time, asynchronous processing. For real-time, async streaming, you might consider other Python libraries like Dask or Apache Beam. Also, please consider that this example is rather abstract. In practice, both get_emoji_reply and translate_emoji would need to interact with the GPT-4 model through some API, which would require further setup and authentication.The point here is to illustrate how an ETL tool could be used to create a similar pipeline, but there are trade-offs to consider.

You should have permissions for actions like iam:ListRoles, iam:ListRolePolicies, iam:GetRolePolicy, etc.Use of AWS SDK: The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) is the preferred method for interacting with AWS services from Python. Make sure you have the Boto3 library installed and configured correctly with your AWS credentials.Paginated Responses: AWS APIs often return paginated responses. Make sure your script is able to handle pagination to retrieve all results.Error Handling: AWS APIs could fail due to numerous reasons, including but not limited to network issues, temporary service unavailability, etc. Your script should include robust error handling logic to deal with these situations gracefully.Security: Be cautious about how you handle AWS credentials in your script. Avoid hardcoding them in your Python script. Instead, use environment variables or AWS profiles.Filtering Roles by Policy: There's no direct API to list roles by attached policy. So you would need to first list all roles, then for each role, list all attached policies, and check if the policy ARN matches the set of policies you are looking for.Rate Limiting: AWS APIs have rate limits. If your account has a large number of IAM roles, then your script may hit these limits. Implement exponential backoff and retry logic in your script to avoid rate limit errors.Performance: The operation described can be time consuming if you have many roles and/or policies. If performance becomes a concern, consider optimizations such as caching.Given these considerations, here's a high-level idea of how your Python script might look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This script would find all roles that have a specific policy attached to them. You would need to adapt it to check for a set of policies, and include the necessary error handling and rate limit handling.
