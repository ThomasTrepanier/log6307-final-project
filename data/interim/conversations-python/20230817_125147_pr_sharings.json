This can be useful for testing and deployment. It's a common practice to have a main entry point in your codebase that handles Lambda event handling and routing.Here are some considerations and tips for structuring your main.py file to work well with both scenarios:Separation of Concerns:\nMake sure your main.py file primarily focuses on event handling and routing. If your actual logic is contained in other modules, keep your main.py file clean and concise.Lambda Event Handling:\nIn your main.py, you can have a function that acts as the entry point for Lambda events. This function will be invoked by AWS Lambda when an event is triggered. You can parse the event data and route it to the appropriate logic.Local Testing:\nFor local testing using python-lambda-local, you can define mock events similar to the events that AWS Lambda would receive. You can then call your event handling function with these mock events to test the behavior.Importing Modules:\nMake sure you correctly import the required modules for your event handling logic. Since your project structure might be different between local development and deployment, ensure that your import paths are accurate in both scenarios.Configuration:\nIf you have configuration settings that are specific to local development or deployment, you can consider using environment variables or configuration files to handle this. For example, you might have different OpenAI API keys or database connection strings.Error Handling:\nBe sure to implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms in your main.py to catch and log any errors that might occur during event handling.Testing:\nBefore deploying to AWS Lambda, thoroughly test your main.py file with different types of events to ensure that it handles them correctly.Here's a basic example of how your main.py might look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Please adapt this example to your project's specific structure and requirements.

Double-check the path to the modules you're trying to import.Package Structure:\nMake sure your project's directory structure is consistent with how you're importing the modules. The structure should match the import paths to avoid any import errors.Python Path:\nLambda functions use the current working directory as the root directory for imports. If your Lambda function is not in the root directory of your project, you might need to adjust the Python path to ensure that your modules can be found. You can use the following code at the beginning of your main.py to adjust the path:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Missing Dependencies:\nEnsure that your Lambda function has all the required dependencies installed. If your code depends on external libraries, make sure they are included in your deployment package.Lambda Layers:\nIf you're using Lambda Layers, make sure that your modules and dependencies are properly organized within the layers.Virtual Environments:\nIf you're using virtual environments for your local development, ensure that the same virtual environment settings are applied in your Lambda environment.Permissions:\nCheck that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the required modules and files in your deployment package.Logs and Errors:\nLook at the CloudWatch logs for your Lambda function to see if there are any error messages related to imports. The logs can provide insights into the specific issue you're facing.Deployment Package:\nEnsure that your deployment package includes all the required modules and files.

Upon predicting whether a Page is a potential\nsplitting point (meaning whether it is first or not), we compare Page's contents to these exclusive first-page strings;\nif there is occurrence of at least one such string, we mark a Page to be first (thus meaning it is a splitting point).\nAn instance of the Context Aware File Splitting Model can be used to initially build a File Splitting pipeline and can\nlater be replaced with more complex solutions.\n\n  A Context Aware File Splitting Model instance can be used with an interface provided by Splitting AI \u2013 this class\naccepts a whole Document instead of a single Page and proposes splitting points or splits the original Documents.\n\n\n- A Multimodal File Splitting Model is a model that uses an approach that takes both visual and textual parts of the\nPages and processes them independently via the combined VGG19 architecture (simplified) and LegalBERT, passing the\nresulting outputs together to a Multi-Layered Perceptron.

This could be as simple as providing an example of a code snippet or a detailed walkthrough of using a specific tool in a particular scenario.Add visuals or diagrams: Diagrams and visuals are effective in conveying complex ideas, process flows, and structures. They can help users understand the architecture of models, how data flows through the system, and so on.Explain acronyms and complex terms: Acronyms like VGG19 and LegalBERT and terms like Multi-Layered Perceptron are technical and may not be understood by everyone. It is helpful to provide a brief explanation or link to additional resources for these terms.Provide information on prerequisites or dependencies: It would be helpful to know if there are any prerequisites or dependencies to use the tools in the SDK. Providing this information up front helps users avoid potential issues later on.Here's a sample revision of the first part of your documentation:OverviewThis guide will help you train your own File Splitting AI using data from your preferred project.

It operates by scanning the category's documents and locating strings that are unique to the first pages of all documents within the category. This model considers a page as the first page, hence a potential splitting point, if it contains at least one of these unique first-page strings.Here's an example of how to use this model with our provided Splitting AI interface:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Multimodal File Splitting ModelThe Multimodal File Splitting Model is a more advanced solution that considers both visual and textual elements of pages.

This is usually not what you want and can lead to issues when trying to play the file.
